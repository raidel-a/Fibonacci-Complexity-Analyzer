# Fibonacci Complexity Analyzer
### COP3337-Project4

## Introduction
This Java project analyzes the computational complexity and performance of calculating Fibonacci numbers. It focuses on understanding the behavior and efficiency of recursive algorithms, specifically applied to the classic Fibonacci number calculation.

## Features
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: Implements both iterative and recursive approaches to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
- **Performance Tracking**: Uses a custom `StopWatch` utility to measure execution time for each calculation.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyzes and displays the growth rate of recursive calls and execution time as the Fibonacci index increases.
- **Data Storage**: Collects and stores execution details in `ExecutionInfo` objects for further analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

## Usage
Run the `Controller.java` file to start the application. The program will calculate Fibonacci numbers and display the analysis of execution time and method calls.
